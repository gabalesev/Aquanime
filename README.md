This artificial intelligence model measures the water supply and optimizes it according to its destination 
(consumption, irrigation, cleaning, etc). The hydraulic network system generates an AI model to optimize 
water distribution and usage. Water is the most precious natural resource. It is not only the primordial 
need of human beings, but also a basic need for economic development. Water scarcity is a growing problem 
throughout the world and is aggravated by population growth. The AI would be fed with operating data from a 
median city (home connections). 75% of all data would be for the learning of artificial intelligence, 25% 
for validation and final tests. Machine learning would be used so that the network learned the behavior of 
the consumers and allowed to regulate the supply.
